server.ts

fetch promises with zod validated schemas in
- products
- categories
- recipes


- product list, product detail, server functions in server component

- product update: client component using server function

- categories: promise created in server consumed in client with "use"
  concept of caching the promise https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUW4xS05Y6s

- recipes: @tanstack useQuery calls server functions from client

- posts: used route handler in api/posts/route.ts with @tanstack useQuery from client

Route Handlers are generally preferred to Server Functions for data fetching. This is because
they improve performance by allowing parallel api requests

movies db:
- listMovies via route handler, fetch with @tanstack useQuery from client
- create movie: used server functions (not route handler). Note: queris.ts require
  'use server' for this to work!
- listMoviewsSWR, useSWR in client, with routeHandler api
- NewMovieSWR, swr mutate
