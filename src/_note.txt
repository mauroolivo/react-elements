api.ts

fetch promises with zod validated schemas in
- products
- categories
- recipes


- product list, product detail, server functions in server component

- product update: client component using server function

- categories: promise created in server consumed in client with "use"
  concept of caching the promise https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUW4xS05Y6s

- recipes: @tanstack useQuery calls server functions from client

- posts: used route handler in api/posts/route.ts with @tanstack useQuery from client

Route Handlers are generally preferred to Server Functions for data fetching. This is because
they improve performance by allowing parallel api requests
